\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the
hazards.}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

This section is broken down into two subsections: one for components within the
system boundary, and one for components outside the system boundary.

\subsection{Inside the System Boundary}

The following components are within the system's control and responsibility:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Embedded firmware:} Real-time operating system and all
embedded software running on the processing unit.

\item \textbf{Signal processing module:} Real-time digital signal processing
algorithms including frequency domain transforms, filtering, and time-domain
analysis.

\item \textbf{Direction of arrival (DoA) estimation:} Algorithms for
computing sound source direction on a 2D plane based on time difference of
arrival and phase differences across microphones.

\item \textbf{Audio classification engine:} Sound fingerprinting and
classification logic to identify and categorize detected sounds (e.g.,
speech, vehicles, alarms).

\item \textbf{Visualization Controller:} \label{comp:viz_controller}
Component reposonsible for creating and sending visualization output to the
glasses.

\item \textbf{Configuration and calibration:} Microphone array calibration
routines and system configuration parameters.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Outside the System Boundary}

The following external entities interact with the system but are not under
its direct control:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Users:} Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing wearing
the device. Their actions, responses to alerts, and interpretation of
displayed information are outside the system's control.

\item \textbf{Environmental sounds:} Acoustic signals in the physical
environment, including speech, vehicle noises, alarms, and ambient sounds.
The system detects and processes these but does not generate or control
them.

\item \textbf{Audio capture subsystem:} Synchronized sampling logic for the
microphone array, including analog-to-digital conversion interfaces and
buffer management. This component is included in the microcontroller and is not
within our system's control.

\item \textbf{Physical microphone hardware:} Microphone sensors that capture
acoustic pressure waves. While the system controls their digital interface,
the physical transduction mechanism is external.

\item \textbf{Smart glasses hardware:} The physical display device,
including its screen, optics, power management, and form factor. The system
sends display commands but does not control the hardware's internal
operation.

\item \textbf{\href{def:microcontroller}{Microcontroller}:}
\label{comp:microcontroller} Component responsible for processing real time
data of sensor inputs. This hardware component's performance and reliability
are outside our system's control.

\item \textbf{Power supply:} Battery or external power source providing
electrical power to system components. Power management at the hardware
level is external to the software system.

\item \textbf{Physical environment:} Room acoustics, ambient noise levels,
temperature, and other environmental factors that affect sound propagation
and microphone performance.
\end{itemize}



\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
\end{enumerate}
