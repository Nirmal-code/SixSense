\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the
hazards.}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\subsection{Severity Mapping Table}
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}

    Rating & Severity & Occurrence & Detection \\\hline
    1 & Negligible & Rare & Easily Detected \\\hline
    2 & Minor & Uncommon & Easily Detected \\ \hline
    3 & Major & Occasional & Moderately Difficult to Detect \\\hline
    4 & Critical & Frequent & Difficult to Detect \\\hline
    5 & Catastrophic & Very Frequent & Almost Impossible to Detect \\


\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Priority Mapping Table}

The priority level is determined by the summation of the severity, occurrence,
and detection ratings. The priority levels are defined as follows:

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
        Product of severities & Priority Level \\\hline
        1 - 4 & Low Priority \\\hline
        5 - 10 & Medium Priority \\\hline
        10 - 15 & High Priority \\

    \end{tabular}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
