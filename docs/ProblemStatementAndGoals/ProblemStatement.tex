\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    
    \textbf{Omar Alam:} I think all members of our team were proactive and genuinely interested in the project presented which made it easier
    to delegate and expect high quality work. 
    
    \textbf{Jay Sharma:} We aligned quickly on the problem and split responsibilities in a way that played to each person's strengths. 
    Our LaTeX/Git workflow came together smoothly, which helped us iterate fast on the documents.
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \textbf{Omar Alam:} Since the project idea incorporates glasses with displays that are visible to the user, we had to do a significant amount
    of research to figure out if it was feasible in the time that we have. We resolved this by developing a contingency plan that would allow us to 
    still allow us to develop the core algorithms without the display glasses.

    \textbf{Jay Sharma:} Our main pain point was deciding on the hardware that we would use for the project. We had to spend a significant amount of time
     researching the different options and their feasibility.
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
    \textbf{Omar Alam:} My team and I spent a significant amount of time researching the feasibility of the project. Since the team does not have much
    experience with signal processing, we decided to consult with Dr. Mohrenschildt to get his opinion on the project. He provided us with valuable feedback on how
    to constraint our project goals to ensure that we can complete the project in the time we have.
    
    \textbf{Jay Sharma:} We started by mapping the problem space, did feasibility analyses, and set criteria around impact, difficulty, and time. 
    We also checked in with Prof. Mohrenschildt to advise the direction of our project and keep the scope focused for the capstone timeline.
