\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the
\href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/main/docs/Checklists/ProbState-Checklist.pdf}
{problem statement checklist}.} 

\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required
information.}

\subsection{Problem}

Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing tend to have difficulties with staying situationally aware, generally leading to increased risk of injury.
Many safety cues such as "the sounds of a tea kettle, the warning beep as a fork lift backs up, and the engine of an oncoming car may be missed". [1]
General sound cues such as someone calling their name, or a phone ringing, may also be missed, often leading to miscommunication and elevated frustration.
With 1 in 10 Canadians being impacted by hearing loss [2], there are over 4 million individuals in Canada dealing with these struggles every day.


\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

The high level input of the system is the audio from the surrounding environments, with the output being an indication of the direction of
audio sources and their respective classifications.

\subsection{Stakeholders}

The primary stakeholders are individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.

\subsection{Environment}

\wss{Hardware and Software Environment}

The software environment is a Linux-based system running C/C++ code.
The hardware environment is a 4 dimentional microphone array, with each microphone connected to the same 4-channel analog digital converter (ADC), and a pair of smart glasses (Rokid Smart Glasses).

    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
