\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the
\href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/main/docs/Checklists/ProbState-Checklist.pdf}
{problem statement checklist}.} 

\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required
information.}

\subsection{Problem}

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\subsection{Stakeholders}

\subsection{Environment}

\wss{Hardware and Software Environment}

\section{Goals}

\section{Stretch Goals}

\section{Extras}

\wss{For CAS 741: State whether the project is a research project. This
designation, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified
over the course of the term.}

\wss{For SE Capstone: List your extras.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  (The full list is on the course outline and in
Lecture 02.) Normally the number of extras will be two.  Approval of the extras
will be part of the discussion with the instructor for approving the project.
The extras, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified
over the course of the term.}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    
    \textbf{Omar Alam:} I think all members of our team were proactive and genuinely interested in the project presented which made it easier
    to delegate and expect high quality work. 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \textbf{Omar Alam:} Since the project idea incorporates glasses with displays that are visible to the user, we had to do a significant amount
    of research to figure out if it was feasible in the time that we have. We resolved this by developing a contingency plan that would allow us to 
    still allow us to develop the core algorithms without the display glasses.
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
    \textbf{Omar Alam:} My team and I spent a significant amount of time researching the feasibility of the project. Since the team does not have much
    experience with signal processing, we decided to consult with Dr. Mohrenschildt to get his opinion on the project. He provided us with valuable feedback on how
    to constraint our project goals to ensure that we can complete the project in the time we have.
