\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    
    \textbf{Omar Alam:} I think all members of our team were proactive and genuinely interested in the project presented which made it easier
    to delegate and expect high quality work. 
    
    \textbf{Kalp Shah:} I think we all had a good understanding of the project after discussing it in detail during
    the write up for the development plan. Due to this, everyone was able to quickly contribute to the problem statement
    and goals without much difficulty.


    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?

    \textbf{Omar Alam:} Since the project idea incorporates glasses with displays that are visible to the user, we had to do a significant amount
    of research to figure out if it was feasible in the time that we have. We resolved this by developing a contingency plan that would allow us to 
    still allow us to develop the core algorithms without the display glasses.
    
    \textbf{Kalp Shah:} I think we did end up spending a lot of time exploring the scope and feasibility of the project while writing the development
    plan which caused us to spend less time writing the problem statement and goals. We ended up writing it all on the day before the deadline which
    was not a problem (as mentioned above - we already knew what to write), but cause a bit of stress.


    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?

    \textbf{Omar Alam:} My team and I spent a significant amount of time researching the feasibility of the project. Since the team does not have much
    experience with signal processing, we decided to consult with Dr. Mohrenschildt to get his opinion on the project. He provided us with valuable feedback on how
    to constraint our project goals to ensure that we can complete the project in the time we have.
    
    \textbf{Kalp Shah:} A lot of what we did for defining the scope of the goals was done through research and consulting with Dr. Mohrenschildt and Dr. Smith.
    Dr. Mohrenschildt helped us better understand the expected time and resource costs of the project since he has experience with similar work and confirmed
    with us that our scope is neither too simple nor too ambitious for a Capstone project.
