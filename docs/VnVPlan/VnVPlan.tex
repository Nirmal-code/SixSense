\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

\wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
has already been verified by its implementation team.}

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.
Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem
statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the
course instructor.  You can use a pull request to update your challenge level
(in TeamComposition.csv or Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the
VnV planning exercise.}

\wss{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.
You can use a pull request to update your extras (in TeamComposition.csv or
Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the VnV planning exercise.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.  You can create BibTeX entries for your
  documents and within those entries include a hyperlink to the documents.}

% \citet{SRS}

\wss{Don't just list the other documents.  You should explain why they are relevant and 
how they relate to your VnV efforts.}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.  You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

Figure \ref{table:vnv_team} outlines the roles and responsibilities of each
team member involved in the verification and validation process. Roles were
intentionally assigned to individuals not directly responsible for the
corresponding implementation components, ensuring an unbiased evaluation of 
system functionality. The supervisor also contributes by providing technical
oversight and expert validation for signal processing.

\end{xltabular}

\subsection{SRS Verification}

The verification of the SRS will follow a structured and systematic process.
Each software requirement will be associated with at least one corresponding
test case, which will verify whether the
implementation satisfies the intended specification. Both unit and integration
testing will be conducted to confirm functionality at the component and system
levels. To avoid bias, test cases will be developed and executed by a team
member who was not directly involved in the implementation of the component.
These fall under the
\hyperref[role:firmware_verfication]{firmware verification},
\hyperref[role:visual_vnv]{visual verification},
\hyperref[role:classification_verfication]{audio classification verification},
\hyperref[role:directional_verfication]{directional analysis verification}
roles. \newline

The team will adopt a new GitHub peer review process to SRS verification. A 
note will be added to the PR template reminding reviewers to confirm that the
software implementation and/or written test cases comply with the requirements
defined in the SRS. If a requirement cannot be met, the reviewer will be
instructed to request an update in a separate PR linked with a rationale for the
change. Below is the text that is included in the PR template addressing this
topic. \newline

\begin{shadedquotation}
Reviewer's Note

- Ensure that all implemented features and/or test cases comply with the SRS.
If any requirement cannot be met, link a separate PR updating the SRS and
explaining the rationale for the change.
\end{shadedquotation}

The 
\hyperref[role:audio_processing_verification]{supervisor verification process}
will follow a formal meeting based review approach. During these meetings,
the team will present core system elements, mainly audio processing
methodologies, using mathematical descriptions,prototype demonstrations,
and graphed data. The supervisor will be provided with targeted review
questions and asked to identify potential weaknesses or missing test cases.
Feedback will be documented, and resulting action items will be tracked
and resolved through the project's issue tracker. \newline


For validation, the team will engage users who are hard of hearing in structured
sessions. These sessions will include observation of product use and
semi-structured interviews. The observation aspect aims to allow the team
understand the usability of the product while the interview serves as a method 
to identify validation issues in addressing user's needs related to situational
awareness. This will fall under the 
\hyperref[role:visual_vnv]{visual validation} and
\hyperref[role:product_validation]{product validation} roles.

\subsection{Design Verification}

The design verification process will include structured peer reviews conducted
by Team 13. They will be provided with the checklist below to verify the desin.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Is the system decomposed into small, modular components that can be
  individually tested?

  \item Are encapsulation principles followed, ensuring that data and functions
  that should be private are private?

  \item Are design assumptions, dependencies, and interfaces clearly defined
  and documented?

  \item Does the selected software architecture appropriately support the
  system's requirements and intended functionality?
\end{itemize}

Reviewers will document feedback on any checklist criteria that are not
satisfied and provide recommendations for improvement. The team will track all 
feedback using the project's issue tracker.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification}

The verification and validation plan verification process will include
structured peer reviews conducted by the Teaching Assistant and Team 13.
They will use the checklist from \texttt{Checklists/VnV-Checklist.pdf}.

\subsection{Implementation Verification}

As outlined in the development plan, the primary source code implementation
will be developed in C/C++. The compiler used to build the source code
will provide warnings of potential bugs. The team will resolve all
warnings that is under the team's control, this excludes warnings from
imported libraries. \newline

The team will also employ Clang Static Analyzer \cite{clangStaticAnalyzer} as
a static analyzer tool. The static analyzer will be employed to detect bugs
without running the source code on the hardware, and will be ran prior to
merging PRs. A note has been added to the PR template to looks similar as below.

\begin{shadedquotation}
Reviewer's Note

- Ensure Clang Static Analyzer shows no errors or warnings for source code
changes
\end{shadedquotation}

The team will also develop test that verify requirements. These tests are
outline in the \hyperref[sec:system_tests][System Tests section].

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{For those capstone teams with an external supervisor, the Rev 0 demo should 
be used as an opportunity to validate the requirements.  You should plan on 
demonstrating your project to your supervisor shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo.  
The feedback from your supervisor will be very useful for improving your project.}

\wss{For teams without an external supervisor, user testing can serve the same purpose 
as a Rev 0 demo for the supervisor.}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\section{System Tests} \label{sec:system_tests}

\wss{There should be text between all headings, even if it is just a roadmap of
the contents of the subsections.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}
		
\paragraph{Title for Test}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Control: Manual versus Automatic
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs.  Output is not how you
are going to return the results of the test.  The output is the expected
result.}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}
					
How test will be performed: 
					
\item{test-id2\\}

Control: Manual versus Automatic

How test will be performed: 

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}
		
\paragraph{Title for Test}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed: 
					
\item{test-id2\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State:

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed: 

\item{...\\}
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Module 2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}
